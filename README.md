# Julia for HPC Birds of a Feather session @ SC25

This repository contains the brief talks presented during the the "[Julia for HPC](https://sc25.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=bof116&sess=sess480)" Birds of a Feather session at the [SuperComputing25](https://sc25.supercomputing.org/) (SC25) conference held in St. Louis (Missouri, USA) on Thursday, 20 November 2025 at 12:15pm - 1:15pm CST

## The Julia Language for Productive High-Performance Computing Tutorial

This year we will also host a [Tutorial at SC25](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/julia-hpc-tutorial-sc25).

## Community

* The Julia Language, and the Julia for HPC communities are incredibly welcoming, for more information, please check out the [Julia Community Pages](https://julialang.org/community/), the [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/), and the [Julia Parallel](https://juliaparallel.org/) community.
The Julia for HPC community meets monthy on Zoom.

* This is an excellent intro-level course on using Julia in Scientific Computing: [Solving PDEs in parallel on GPUs with Julia](https://pde-on-gpu.vaw.ethz.ch/)
